                    <p>Nothing is more Roatan than the endemic, endangered Black Iguana, also known as the Roatan Spiny Tailed Iguana. Only found on the islands of Roatan and Barbareta and on Roatan there are only a few thousand left. Weâ€™ve partnered with the scientific community through the International Iguana Foundation and with the Ft. Worth, Texas Zoo to help preserve this species. A portion of all our merchandise sales goes directly to fund the annual Iguana research conducted on Roatan. Please help us support the protection of this incredible species of Iguana!</p>

                        There are 3 directors of the project with widely varied backgrounds. The common ground is
                        that they are friends and love Roatan. Our President, Kevin Wesley, is a Roatan native and
                        prominent figure in Roatan. He has built churches, schools, and even entire resorts prior to
                        dreaming up the West Bay Golf Course project. He is joined by a friend, Jimmy Mikkelsen, who has built golf courses by Dye Designs for more than 20 years. And finally, Worth and Kristine Jennings who have been home owners and frequent travelers to Roatan for more than a decade.
